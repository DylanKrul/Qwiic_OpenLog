  Qwiic OpenLog records any incoming byte to the default log file. If quered by the master it will
  normally respond with a status byte with the following structure:

  Bit 0: SD/Init Good
  Bit 1: Last Command Succeeded
  Bit 2: Last Command Known
  Bit 3: File Currently Open
  Bit 4: In Root Directory
  Bit 5: 0 - Future Use
  Bit 6: 0 - Future Use
  Bit 7: 0 - Future Use
  
  NewSerial uses approximately 60 bytes less RAM than built-in Serial so we use NewSerial library.

  At 115200bps with OpenLog Serial, it logged 11,520 bytes per second with a few buffer overruns
  At 100kHz I2C that's 10,000 bytes per second (10-bits per byte in I2C). Should be ok.
  At 400kHz, that's 40,000 bytes per second. We're going to need clock stretching.

  Red LED is 1.8V forward voltage. 3.3V - 1.8V = 1.5V across 1k = 1.5mA for the "PWR" LED

  What are the options we could set over I2C?
  Set escape character
  Set number of escape characters
  New file logging vs append logging
  Reset file number

  Need to check status byte from examples to see if OpenLog has SD card and is online

  (done) list files
  (done) make directory
  remove directory
  (done) change dir
  (done) read file
  (done) write to file
  (done) append
  (done) new
  (no) echo
  (done) size
  (no) disk
  reset

  Working! Records great 110k at 400kHz. Clock stretches correctly.
  The clock stretch occurs every 36ms, curious... Probably happening every 512 byte write

  Write example that scans for I2C devices to find lost OpenLog

  Commands look like this:
  "new test.txt" - Create file 'test.txt' in current directory
  "append test.txt" - Create (if not exist) and append to file 'test.txt'
  "md day2" - Make directory day2
  "cd day2" - Change directory to day2
  (future) "set <recording type>" - Set recording type. 0 = Create new log each power up, 1 = Append to SeqLog
  (future) "adr <i2c address>" - Change I2C address. Valid/allowed addresses are 0x08 to 0x77.
  (future) "esc <byte>" - Change escape character. Valid 0x01 to 0xFE.
  (future) "num <byte>" - Change number of escape characters. Valid 0x00 to 0xFF
  If the master issues a read after these commands are sent, QOL responds with systemStatus byte

  "ls" - List files and subdirectories in current directory
  "ls *.*" - List files in current directory
  "ls *<forwardslash>" - List subdirectories in current directory
  If the master issues a read after this command, QOL responds with /0 terminated string of object.
  Each subsequent read gets another object.
  Directory names end in / character.

  "size <file>" - Get size of file. -1 if file does not exist
  If the master issues a read after this command, QOL responds with 4 bytes, signed long of file size

  "read test.txt <start> <length> <type>" - Get contents of file
  If the master issues a read after this command, QOL responds with up to 32 bytes of file contents
  Used size command prior to read to determine the number of bytes to read.

  (future) "get <setting>" - status = 1 if success
  if the master issues a read after this command, QOL responds with the adr, esc, num, or set value

  (future) "default" = 1 if success
  reset to all factory settings

  (future) set time/date via timestamp and dateTimeCallback() function

  6 = OpenLog
  8 = Master
