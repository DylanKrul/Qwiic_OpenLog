  Qwiic OpenLog records any incoming byte to the default log file. If quered by the master OpenLog will
  normally respond with a status byte with the following structure:

  Bit 0: SD/Init Good
  Bit 1: Last Command Succeeded
  Bit 2: Last Command Known
  Bit 3: File Currently Open
  Bit 4: In Root Directory
  Bit 5: 0 - Future Use
  Bit 6: 0 - Future Use
  Bit 7: 0 - Future Use

  At 115200bps with OpenLog Serial, it logged 11,520 bytes per second with a few buffer overruns
  At 100kHz I2C that's 10,000 bytes per second (10-bits per byte in I2C). Should be ok.
  At 400kHz, that's 40,000 bytes per second. We're going to need clock stretching.

  Red LED is 1.8V forward voltage. 3.3V - 1.8V = 1.5V across 1k = 1.5mA for the "PWR" LED

  3.5mA during idle
  12mA during constant write
  2.85mA idle, no card

  Why do we use NewSerial? NewSerial uses approximately 60 bytes less RAM than built-in Serial.

  Recording works great at 400kHz. Clock stretches correctly.
  The clock stretch occurs every 36ms, curious... Probably happening every 512 byte write

  Commands look like this:
  "new test.txt" - Create file 'test.txt' in current directory
  "append test.txt" - Create (if not exist) and append to file 'test.txt'
  "md day2" - Make directory day2
  "cd day2" - Change directory to day2
  "set 1" - Set recording type to SeqLog. 0 = Create new log each power up, 1 = Append to SeqLog
  "adr 98" - Change I2C address to 98. Valid/allowed addresses are 0x08 to 0x77.
  "esc 36" - Change escape character tp $. Valid 0 to 255
  "num 5" - Change number of escape characters to 5. Valid 0 to 255
  "log 100" - Change number of log to start at LOG00100.TXT. Valid 0 to 65,534
  If the master issues a read after these commands are sent, QOL responds with systemStatus byte

  "ls" - List files and subdirectories in current directory
  "ls *.*" - List files in current directory
  "ls *<forwardslash>" - List subdirectories in current directory
  If the master issues a read after this command, QOL responds with /0 terminated string of object.
  Each subsequent read gets another object.
  Directory names end in / character.
  
  "rm LOG*.TXT" - Remove all files that have the name LOG?????.TXT.
  "rm MONDAY" - Remove the *empty* directory MONDAY
  "rm -rf MONDAY" - Remove the directory MONDAY and any files within it

  "size <file>" - Get size of file. -1 if file does not exist
  If the master issues a read after this command, QOL responds with 4 bytes, signed long of file size

  "read test.txt <start> <length> <type>" - Get contents of file
  If the master issues a read after this command, QOL responds with up to 32 bytes of file contents
  Used size command prior to read to determine the number of bytes to read.

  "get <setting>" - Get the value of a setting
  If the master issues a read after this command, QOL responds with the adr, esc, num, or set value

  "default" - Reset to all factory settings
  Normal logging, address to 42, escape to 26, escape num to 3, log number to zero.
  Begin logging with the first log number available

  (future) Set time/date via timestamp and dateTimeCallback() function

  See if increasing the buffer size(S) increases record from 21k to more
